This is the second version for the implementation and
testing of the GRAPE algorithm described here:
http://www.org.chemie.tu-muenchen.de/glaser/94(GRAPE_JMR_05).pdf

In this version we implement the control for large driving forces
in a rotating frame for a single qubit using fourier analysis to
limit the spectrum of frequencies we use for the driving force.
This also means we use a custom performance function.
